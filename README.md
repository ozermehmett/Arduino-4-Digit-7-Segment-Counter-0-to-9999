# Arduino-4-Digit-7-Segment-Counter-0-to-9999
This project demonstrates an Arduino-based counter using a 4-digit 7 segment display. The counter counts from 0 to 9999 and displays the current value on the 7 segment display.

## Description
The Arduino 4-Digit 7 Segment Counter project utilizes an Arduino board and a 4-digit 7 segment display to create a digital counter. The counter starts from 0 and increments up to 9999, displaying the current value on the 7 segment display.

The project involves connecting the Arduino board and the 4-digit 7 segment display properly, and then uploading the provided Arduino sketch to the board. The sketch utilizes various functions to control the display of each digit on the 7 segment display.

## Circuit Diagram

The circuit diagram below illustrates the connections between the Arduino board and the 4-digit 7 segment display:

## Features

- Counts from 0 to 9999
- Utilizes a 4-digit 7 segment display to display the current value
- Easy to understand and modify Arduino sketch

## Components

To build this project, you will need the following components:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- 4-digit 7 segment display
- Jumper wires

## Installation and Usage

1. Connect the 4-digit 7 segment display to the appropriate pins on the Arduino board based on the circuit diagram.
2. Install the Arduino IDE if you haven't already.
3. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
4. Open the Arduino sketch (`arduino_counter.ino`) in the Arduino IDE.
5. Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
6. Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE.
7. Click the "Upload" button to upload the sketch to the Arduino board.
8. The counter will start counting from 0 to 9999, displaying the current value on the 4-digit 7 segment display.

## Customization

You can customize this project in several ways:

- Adjust the delay between each digit display to change the speed of the counter.
- Modify the pin assignments in the sketch if you are using different pins for the 4-digit 7 segment display.
- Implement additional functionality, such as adding buttons to control the counter.
